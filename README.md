## About the project
Final project of Programming classes in fourth semester of Computer Science studies that simulates the behavior of the cryptocurrency exchange. 

The Project is written in the C++ language and uses Qt Creator Environment. I decided to download rates' data from last 3 years of the following cryptocurrencies:
* Bitcoin 
* Ethereum
* Binance Coin
* Tether
* Ripple

The cryptocurrencies' data are accurate to the within day but a user can freely change the date in the program to bring the results forward. 
I've already implemanted below features but there will be much more. I am going to add:
* Order functionality e.g. *Market Orders* and *Stop Loss Limit Orders*.
* CFD functionality
* Cryptocurrency graphs
* Graphs that visualize current state of user's cryptocurrency 
* Orderbook functionality
