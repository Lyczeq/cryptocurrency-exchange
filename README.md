When a user wants to send a transfer, he has to enter the following information: recipent's email, the title, cryptocurrency and the amount of money.
If he doesn't have enough money or the recipent doesn't exist, he will get a proper message.

# Plans for the future
I am going to implement functionalities mentioned above but also work on the UI and UX. 

I hope you enjoy it, have a nice day! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="24px" alt="hi">
